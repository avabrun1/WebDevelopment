        This webpage was made to make learning Spanish & English a fun experience for kids! Through these interactive games, kids and people of all ages can build their understanding of a language while having a good time. Our mission is to create a playful learning environment, while still encouraging curiosity and confidence in a new language. By intertwining education with entertainment, this project entices kids to explore bilingualism in a way that makes you feel like youâ€™re playing, not work!
